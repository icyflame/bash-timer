Cube Timer inside the Bash Shell
================================

As a cuber, you have a thousand times stored, probably in the cookies of your browser, and accidentally, you remove the cookies. Either you do it, or something bad happens and it happens on its own. In any case, you lost all the times you had stored.

That's where this script comes in. This script will push all the times to a GitHub repository. As soon as you record them. Or at the end of a session. You can decide how you want to play.

This script will create a text file that will store all the files. And separate files for different cubes (3x3, 2x2 etc).
